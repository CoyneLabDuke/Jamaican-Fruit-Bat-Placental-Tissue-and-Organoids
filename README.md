This repository contains the analysis code for bulk RNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq data from the manuscript "Cellular and Immune Adaptations at the Maternalâ€“Fetal Interface in Bats." It includes scripts for data preprocessing, integration, differential expression, and visualization. An interactive ShinyApp for exploring the data is available at: https://coynelab.shinyapps.io/bat-placenta-explorer/.
